# Project Performance Framework
## Objectives, outputs, outcomes and criteria
Below is the summary table of the Objectives, Outputs, Outcomes and Criteria of this project. Project outcomes have been classified into short, medium and long term impacts.
The goal of this project is to re-establish the internal and external consistency of these networks. This is expected to be accomplished by an integrated survey using both conventional and contemporary methods. Primary objectives would include the retracement of all networks to re-establish internal consistency of established control; re-integration of existing local UCG network control to ASCM geodetic control, and; establishment of new network control to current geodetic standards. Outputs for this project will be an updated coordinate list, reduce errors  and a procedural manual for the maintenance and upkeep of the network in the future. The outcomes of this project will 
> -	Objectives: Define what the project is trying to achieve.
> -	Outputs: Deliverables and products produced by the project.
> -	Outcomes: Impact you are working to realize such as behaviours and practices that results from the outputs. They can be short, medium or long term.

> For the measurement criteria provide a statement that describes what the project will accomplish and the performance measure. The project objectives whenever possible should be written to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely (SMART). The measurement criteria specifies a metric(s) that will measure success.  

## Project Performance Measurement Plan
> For each project objective and measurement criteria identified in the above table, indicate the methods used to measure, who is responsible, frequency of measurement, key targets and reporting on results. For example, if there are three(3) project objectives, fill out a performance measurement plan for each objective.

## Sustainability
> Plans for maintenance include: Generating a standard procedure for future local observations and adjustments; Creating a firmware procedure to update the network in the future. Further development of this project would include digitizing the network records to track changes of the network, modular adjustment procedures and maintenance schedules. The years following GeoConnections' funded project, it is expected that the geodetic control (ASCMs) established as part of this project will be maintained by the geodetic society (REF). The organization that will be responsible for maintaining this project through its lifecycle will be ________ .



> Collaborators in this project will be the people who will use the network in the future to develop their geomatics knowledge. Industry professionals etc etc...
