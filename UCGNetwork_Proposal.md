# Project Overview
## Project Name
## Project Description
> The University of Calgary’s current control network is used by the department of Geomatics engineering for undergraduate courses requiring field work and for research purposes as necessary. These networks would benefit from resurveys to reflect any deformations that have occurred as a result of passage of time.  

> The aim of this project is to determine and remedy the internal consistencies of the existing control networks in and near the University of Calgary and tie them into high precision network and adjust the campus network to reflect a high standard.

# Project Performance Framework
## Objectives, outputs, outcomes and criteria
Below is the summary table of the Objectives, Outputs, Outcomes and Criteria of this project. Project outcomes have been classified into short, medium and long term impacts.
The goal of this project is to re-establish the internal and external consistency of these networks. This is expected to be accomplished by an integrated survey using both conventional and contemporary methods. Primary objectives would include the retracement of all networks to re-establish internal consistency of established control; re-integration of existing local UCG network control to ASCM geodetic control, and; establishment of new network control to current geodetic standards. Outputs for this project will be an updated coordinate list, reduce errors  and a procedural manual for the maintenance and upkeep of the network in the future. The outcomes of this project will

## Sustainability
> Plans for maintenance include: Generating a standard procedure for future local observations and adjustments; Creating a firmware procedure to update the network in the future. Further development of this project would include digitizing the network records to track changes of the network, modular adjustment procedures and maintenance schedules. The years following GeoConnections' funded project, it is expected that the geodetic control (ASCMs) established as part of this project will be maintained by the geodetic society (REF). The organization that will be responsible for maintaining this project through its lifecycle will be ________ .
